## Claims
1. People have survived being struck by lightning. What's the greatest number of times someone has been struck by lightning and lived to tell the tale?

    **Seth's guess:** ten times

    **Luke's guess:** seven times
    
    **Actual answer:** seven times! [Roy Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Sullivan) was a park ranger and was struck seven times in his 71 years of life. This is *extremely* unlikely for the average person, but Roy's odds were a bit higher due to the nature of his work (being outside in open areas often) and the area where he lived (Virginia).

2. Does lightning start in the cloud or on earth?

    **Seth's guess:** starts on earth

    **Luke's guess:** starts in the sky
    
    **Actual answer:** [both](http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/lightning/faq/)! A positive stream of energy is "sent out" from objects on the ground, and a negative stream of energy comes from the sky. When the two streams meet, the visible burst zips upward to the sky from the ground (though it doesn't always touch the ground).

3. Why did Benjamin Franklin do his famous lightning strike experiment?

    **Seth's guess:** to test his new invention, the lightning rod

    **Luke's guess:** science related to conductivity
    
    **Actual answer:** believe it or not we don't actually have much evidence that this experiment *actually* took place. Regardless, we do know the [Franklin was really interested in electricity](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/franklin-flies-kite-during-thunderstorm) and [invented the household version of the lightning rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_rod#History) the year after this experiment supposedly took place.

## Additional references
Here's a [handy reference from NOAA](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/lightning/resources/LightningFactsSheet.pdf) about lightning safety. In addition to a bunch of useful safety tips, it also describes the counting method for determining how far a lightning strike is from you (one mile for every five seconds, by the way).
