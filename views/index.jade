                p This podcast is dedicated to appreciating the things that we don't understand. Seth and Luke randomly select topics that they're not particularly knowledgeable of and discuss them in an attempt to better understand the wold around them.

                h2 Who we are
                p Seth Rushton and Luke Segars first became friends in 1996, the same year the world was introduced to Ask Jeeves. They stuck together throughout the twists and turns of the two decades that followed (Y2K! The invention of YouTube and Facebook! Three different reboots of the Hulk franchise!) to get to the present day where they still spend too much time with one another. 
                p Over the years, these two developed quite different academic interests; Luke went to graduate school in computer science (what a dreamer!) while Seth did the same thing but for American literature and religion (always the pragmatist!). However, even though they have wildly different specialities, both men share an enthusiasm for curiosity and are genuinely interested  in how every aspect of the modern world works.
